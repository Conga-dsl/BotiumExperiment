utter_nep_bachelor
Under this proposed 4-year programme, students can exit, • After one year with a certificate, • After two years with a diploma, and • After three years with a bachelor’s degree. • Four-year bachelor’s programmes generally include a certain amount of research work. Therefore, the student will get deeper knowledge in the subject s/he decides to major in. After four years, a UG student could enter a research degree programme directly depending on how well s/he has performed. However, master’s degree programmes will continue to function as they do, following which student may do a PhD.
