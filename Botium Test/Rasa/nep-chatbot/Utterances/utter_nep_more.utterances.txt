School education - The new NEP focuses on overhauling the curriculum and easier Board exams. It also focused on a reduction in the syllabus to retain core essentials and thrust on experiential learning and critical thinking. It pitches for a “5+3+3+4” design of school education in the place of a “10+2” structure. This design will be corresponding to age groups 3-8 years (foundational stage), 8-11 (preparatory), 11-14 (middle), and 14-18 (secondary). This brings early childhood education (pre-school education for children of ages 3 to 5) under the ambit of formal schooling. The mid-day meal programme will be extended to pre-school children. The NEP says students until Class 5 should be taught in their mother tongue or regional language. Higher education - The NEP proposes to open up Indian higher education to foreign universities. It proposes to dismantle the UGC and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). It proposes to introduce a 4-year multidisciplinary UG programme with multiple exit options, and discontinuation of the M Phil programme. It also proposes phasing out of all institutions offering single streams. It says that all universities and colleges must aim to become multidisciplinary by 2040.
