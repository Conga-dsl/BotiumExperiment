The new NEP focuses on overhauling the curriculum and easier Board exams. It also focused on a reduction in the syllabus to retain core essentials and thrust on experiential learning and critical thinking. It pitches for a “5+3+3+4” design of school education in the place of a “10+2” structure. This design will be corresponding to age groups 3-8 years (foundational stage), 8-11 (preparatory), 11-14 (middle), and 14-18 (secondary). This brings early childhood education (pre-school education for children of ages 3 to 5) under the ambit of formal schooling. The mid-day meal programme will be extended to pre-school children. The NEP says students until Class 5 should be taught in their mother tongue or regional language.
